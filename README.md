# swapi

## What is this?

Just a simple client implementation of the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/)

## Libs used
- `vue` as the main components framework
- `element-ui` to speed up the UI development
- `jest` and `@vue/test-utils` for testing

## To see te project running

But there is a warning, for some reason, google changed the custom search api free quota, so I developed a "cache" system for the responses.

npm install
```

### Run your unit tests
